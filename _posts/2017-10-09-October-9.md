This week, I am reading and implementing the first step and second step that is discussed in the paper. The first step is to linearly detrend the data. It linearly detrends the data by taking the least square fitted line of the data and turns the data a certain degree so that the fitted line is horizontal. The second step is to create a matrix that uses sliding window technique to determine where the peaks occur. If there is a peak, then there will be lots of zeros in a row. There will be a randomly distributed numbers in a row if it is not a peak. I was able to plot the detrended data and also applied Savitzky-Golay to smooth the curve. See attached plots.
