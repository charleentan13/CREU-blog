I have finished implementing the laplacian of Gaussian for peak detection. What it looks like to me is I have to try run the data with various standard deviation in order to see the strongest signal. I also have to normalize the ouputs in order to compare among the different standard deviation. Thus, for next week, I will normalize the output and try the various standard deviation.
