I have been stuck on replicating the peak detection method by Scholkmann, Boss and Wolf on peak detection in noisy data. I want to work on peak detection because there is connection between the peak occurence and peak size. The peak often occurs in the afternoon and the peak size varies from day to day. It would be interesting to see what is the correlation between the peaks occurence and the chemical substances of the day in the morning. The goal for project is to find what the correlations are. In order to find the correlations, we need to be able to detect the peak accurately. 

I have found another method to detect the peaks using convolution with gaussian to find the peaks. And I hope to implement this in this week.
