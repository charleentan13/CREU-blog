This week has been a particularly busy week for me. I've been studying for a lot of midterms, and couldn't find enough time to work on research. Luckily, next week is my spring break. I hope I can use some of my spring break time to make up for the delay in my research. 

Next week, I plan to write a formal (or semi-formal) writeup for the research I have finished. The writeup will be a summary of the algorithms I implemented and the results I obtained. Also, the report will contain my thoughts on how this project can proceed further.
