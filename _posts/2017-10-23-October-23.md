I have finished implementing the sliding window algo matrix. But, there is some issue I had with the data in the matrix. From furthur the step, I learned that there is a peak when the std of a column is equal to 0. That means, the entire column has values of 0 which is quite impossible. I see that there should be a column with most number of consecutive zeros and compare with that number with the lambda cutoff point. Therefore, I would try to reason this part out next week.
