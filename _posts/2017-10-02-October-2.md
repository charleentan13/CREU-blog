In this week, I have been doing literature searching and reading. One paper that I had come across is "Auto-Threshold Peak Detection in Physiological Signal". In this paper, the algorithm categorizes the points into two: positive slope and 0 slope. However, my dataset contains lots of noise and basically all of them have positive slope which is not ideal to use the algorithm. So, I found another paper that works with more noisy data, called "An Efficient Algorithm for Automatic Peak Detection in Noisy Periodic and Quasi-Periodic Signals" which have multiple steps to process the data.
