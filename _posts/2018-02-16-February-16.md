This week, I ran the code on all the dates that I have and compared the normalized output for various standard deviation. I have recorded the time where the peak occurs and also some found some strange data where there is no peak. The algorithm was able to correctly show that there is no significant peak identified. For next week, I would have to use the values of the peak to see if there is any relationship with other things involved and also find a reason to explain the data where there is no peak.
