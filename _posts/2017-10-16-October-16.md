Over the past week, I have tried to implement sliding window algorithm for peak detection. Because the index starts with 1 and 1 in the matrix, and the actual matrix in the code starts with 0,0. So, it was hard to track the constraints and parameters index for filling the matrix. I have been debugging the implementation for this algorithm.
